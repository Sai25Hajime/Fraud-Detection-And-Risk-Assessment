This is our Applied Data Science Case Study Project

## üö® Fraud Detection & Risk Assessment - Applied Data Science (ADS) Case Study

This repository contains the **Applied Data Science (ADS)** case study, developed as part of our academic curriculum. The project focuses on **fraud detection** and **risk assessment** using data science techniques and models to analyze and predict fraudulent activities in financial datasets.

## üß† Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to design and implement a fraud detection and risk assessment model that can efficiently identify potentially fraudulent transactions or activities within a given dataset. The system applies machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to detect suspicious patterns and assess risks associated with different financial entities.

## üî¨ Approach & Methodology

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
  Data was gathered from [specify the source or type of data] and preprocessed using techniques like data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

- **Feature Selection & Engineering:**  
  Focus was placed on selecting features that contribute significantly to predicting fraudulent behavior and assessing risk. Various statistical and data mining techniques were used to identify important features.

- **Modeling & Evaluation:**  
  Several machine learning models were trained to detect fraud, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas, Numpy (Data Manipulation)
  - Scikit-Learn (Modeling & Evaluation)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
  - XGBoost (for boosted trees, if applicable)
